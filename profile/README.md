Scribes were an elite in ancient societies, highly regarded and holding special social status. They were disciplined and known for their excellent craftsmanship in writing laws, copying documents, and other related tasks.

The motivation to create the Elixir Scribe tool was to encourage developers to write **Clean Code** in a **Clean Software Architecture**, to enable them to know in seconds all domains, resources, and actions used in a project, while reducing complexity and contributing for less technical debt.

The Elixir Scribe tool enables developers to go from zero to hero in no time, while empowering their craftsmanship and professionalism to reach new levels never imagined before or thought to not be easy to achieve.

Don't just be a Developer or Engineer, become a Scribe Developer and Engineer.

### Elixir Scribe

The [Elixir Scribe](https://github.com/Elixir-Scribe/elixir-scribe) code generators aims to help developers to embody the values of discipline and craftsmanship of the Scribes, enabling them to more easily write clean code in a clean software architecture for enhanced developer experience and productivity.

Check the [Roadmap](https://github.com/Elixir-Scribe/elixir-scribe?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap) to known what's planned and [Next Release](https://github.com/Elixir-Scribe/elixir-scribe?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap) to know what is coming next.


#### 📢 Elixir Typed Contracts without the boilerplate

At the base of the code generators are the Elixir [Typed Contracts](https://github.com/Elixir-Scribe/elixir-scribe/releases/tag/v0.2.0):

👉 Use them to reduce validation of data correctness across the modules where this data is typically required.

👉 The use of typed contracts also helps to reduce the number of tests you need to write.

👉 Most importantly, it reduces bugs that slip into production.

🎯 Start using it today and thank me later.

💡Maybe I should extract the #ElixirScribe Typed Contracts into their own package❓
